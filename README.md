## 📦 La Installation for `C`

### 𓀃 The Actual Installation🤌🤌

#### You can use [Programiz Complier](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/online-compiler/) or similar online compliers to run the code

#### But if you're using e.g. Windows Powershell you should:

- Make sure you have MinGW installed. You can install it using [VisualStudio](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw#_prerequisites):

  ```
  gcc --version
  ```
  
- [Download](https://github.com/JakubStachh/C-Simple-Projects/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the code
- Unpack the zip file
- Open the folder of the program You want to try out
- and then run:

  **For C**:
  ```
  g++ hello.c -o hello.exe
  ```
  **For C++**:
  ```
  g++ hello.cpp -o hello.exe
  ```
  ##
- For C# You will have to check if you got [`.NET SDK`](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet) installed:
  ```
  dotnet --version
  ```
- Then compile & run the C# program:
  ```
  csc hello.cs
  .\Hello.exe
  ```
- If it doesn't work you can:

  Create new console:
  ```
  dotnet new console -n MyConsoleApp
  ```
  Get into the folder of that console:
  ```
  cd MyConsoleApp
  ```

  Build the project:
  ```
  dotnet build
  ```

  Replace the code of the `Program.cs` and run it:

  ```
  dotnet run
  ```

# THANK YOU!
```python
1. And Voilà! You've done it! You've actually checked my code! 
2. Thank You. All I'm hoping for is... that I hadn't made any mistakes.
3. Well... maybe... rather: that they're not THAT serious.....
4. If there are any: I'm sorry, and I will update it when the right time comes.... 
5. But for now... let's enjoy this peacful while with - beloved by many - EL SNOOPY!!!
